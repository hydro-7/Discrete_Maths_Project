# Warshalls Algorithm Visualizer : 

For a Directed Graph, its Transitive Closure of a **Relation R** on a **Set A** is defined as the smallest **symmetric relation** that contains R. These transitive closures help to find the **Max Reachability** of the graph.

To calculate this Transitive Closure, we use the Warshall's Algorithm. It has a **Time Complexity of :** `O(n^3)`.
